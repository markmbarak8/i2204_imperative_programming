void main(){
    // in the below example p is a null pointer(pointer that has no reference) which is dereferenced
    // and assigned to 54. Although this will compile fine, at runtime it will corrupt memory in some
    // way, and the program will crash sooner or later.
    // int *p;
    // *p=54;
    // printf("%i\n",*p);
    // of course printing the reference of a null pointer without assigning anything will output garbage value
